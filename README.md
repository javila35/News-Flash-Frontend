# News Flash
*A full-stack web app by Joe Avila*
Update on 03/01/2021: I am currently rewriting the app to use Typescript and some new tricks I've learned since original release.

#### [News Flash Deployed](https://news-flash-50a6e.web.app/)
*Please allow some time for backend to load up.*
#### [Backend Repo](https://github.com/javila35/News-Flash-Backend)

## Tools Utilized

    * Loading graphics
* Redux:
    * Saving logged user in store.
    * Saving navigation display across page re-renders.
* CSS: 
    * All CSS written by me (with lots of help from Stack Overflow and W3schools.)
    * I am migrating to use Material UI.
* GNews API
    * Thank you to GNews for providing solid documentation about an API that feeds my website.
        
## Features to Add
* User will be able to save searches as a link in the navigation.
* Users can decide what topics they want as a ticker on their homepage.

### Set Up
**You will need to set up the backend, before the front end for usability.**
* Fork and clone this repository.
* Run ```npm install``` in your terminal to download needed dependencies.
* Run ```npm start``` in your terminal **after starting backend server**.
